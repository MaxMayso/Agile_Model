# Agile_Model

  Creating and interpreting user stories, helps immensely with software development in the agile model. These "user stories" are used to decipher the wants and needs of the market demand of the software product directly from the user experience of the application, program, algorithm, etc. 
Interpreting a "user story" consists of two main parts. The first part is the demand, and the second part is the reason for that demand. For example "As a user, I want to be able to filter my friends, so that I can find them faster." 
Breaking that up, and using it to evolve the program is the pinnacle of user-based development and putting their customers first.

Developing programs in an agile development environment isn't simple. It's requires to be flexible, have exceptional organization skills with your code management, and development methods that may not be cut out exactly the same for every program. Some product may take a scrum approach, while others take a Kanban approach. It is up to the scrum master/project manager to make that call. 

No matter the difference, through an inclusive environment, a team-based approach, and transparency, any scrum team can be set up to succeed. A good team member should exhibit all these factors, plus adding their own innovative flavor to the scrum team. There is absolutely always more room for communication in software development. A good team member will mentor when they need to, and be mentored when it's appropriate. 

I hope you enjoy my agile model retrospective, and powerpoint. 

Thank you,
